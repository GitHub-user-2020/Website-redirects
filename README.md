# Website-redirects
A set of file(s) that aim to redirect users of popular websites to free(r) frontends.

# Instructions

1. Go to https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector and install the browser extension.
2. Using the browser extension, import the Redirector.json file provided.

Alternatively, the provided Redirector.json file may be freely parsed by the user with the software of their choice.

# Limitations

Currently, the provided file only redirects users from YouTube, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter. Alternative frontends to those websites can be freely modified to the user's wish; I have merely provided these websites as examples for users to work from.
